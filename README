This repo contains scripts and metadata to build a MOBI e-book file out of Johannes Kreidler's
Programming Electronic Music in Pd.

Usage:
* Download Amazon's KindleGen (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621)
* Run ./build-mobi.sh

The content will be scraped from pd-tutorial.com and a .mobi file will be generated,
suitable for reading on your Kindle or equivalent e-book device.

Note that none of the copyrighted content of the book is contained in this repo,
but is fetched as part of the convertion process.
